#  Hogwarts Info Hub

A magical space to explore information about Harry Potter characters, spells, and houses — all in one place.


##  What It Does

The Hogwarts Info Hub is a React-based web app that connects to the HP API to display rich information about the Wizarding World. You can:

-Browse a list of wizards with their house, image, and other details
-Explore spells with names and descriptions
-Search for specific characters
-View house-specific styling for an immersive Hogwarts experience


## WHY?

The Wizarding World is huge and full of lore. This app provides a fun, themed way to learn about Harry Potter characters and spells, while practicing API integration, React state management, and dynamic styling.


## Built With
-React (Vite or Create React App, depending on your setup)
-JavaScript (ES6+)
-Public APIs (HP API)
-Custom Themed Styling (Harry Potter–inspired fonts, colors, and card designs)


## API Used
- https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters
- https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/spells

## Known Issues of Challenges
-The HP API is public and may occasionally be slow or temporarily unavailable.

-Some characters or spells may have missing data (e.g., no image or description).

-Styling is customized for fun, so exact color accuracy for Hogwarts houses may differ slightly from official sources.
